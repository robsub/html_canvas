    The canvas is a two-dimensional rectangular area. The coordinates of the top-left corner of the canvas are (0, 0) which is known as origin, and the 
    coordinates of the bottom-right corner are (canvas width, canvas height). Here's a simple demonstration of canvas default coordinate system.

//  The most basic path you can draw on canvas is a straight line. The most essential methods used for this purpose are moveTo(), lineTo() and the stroke().


        window.onload = function() {
            var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
            var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
            


            context.moveTo(0, 0); // moveTo() method defines the position of drawing cursor onto the canvas,
            context.lineTo(300, 200); // lineTo() method used to define the coordinates of the line's end point, 
            context.stroke(); // stroke() method is used to make the line visible. Let's try out an example:

         
            context.moveTo(300, 0); // moveTo() method defines the position of drawing cursor onto the canvas,
            context.lineTo(0, 200); // lineTo() method used to define the coordinates of the line's end point, 
            context.stroke(); // stroke() method is used to make the line visible. Let's try out an example:

    Task one: I have one line, how can I create an X shape? i wanna create an X that spins around and mess with the speed until its just right n looks cool.
